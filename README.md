Our database has crashed and we need your help to slowly rebuild. 



It looks like your Pokémon has just evolved, and its stats have increased by 20% (Well done you!)! Now, it’s time to calculate its new stat (integer) after evolution. 

Given the original pokemonStat return the newly evolved Pokemon Stats

  250XP ---> 300XP
  1050XP ---> 1260XP
  10XP ---> 12XP
```
Head over to our <ins>main.js</ins> folder to pick up where we left off!

#### Make sure to install vitest into your 'devDependencies'
