# Pokémon Evolver

Our database has crashed and we need your help to slowly rebuild. 

It looks like your Pokémon has just evolved, and its stats have increased by 20 (Well done you!)! Now, it’s time to calculate its new stats after evolution. 

Given the original pokemonStat return the newly evolved Pokemon Stats

//OUTPUT Example:

// 250XP ---> 300XP
// 1050XP ---> 1260XP
// 10XP ---> 12XP
