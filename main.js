//Your Pokémon just evolved, and its stats increased by 20%! You need to calculate the new stats for a Pokémon based on its original stat value. Write a function that takes the original stat as input and returns the evolved stat after applying the 20% increase.

//OUTPUT Example:

// 250XP ---> 300XP
// 1050XP ---> 1260XP
// 10XP ---> 12XP


export function pokemonEvolveNewStats(pokemonStat) {
