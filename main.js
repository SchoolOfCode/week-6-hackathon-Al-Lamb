/* Pokémon Evolver

Our database has crashed and we need your help to slowly rebuild. 

It looks like your Pokémon has just evolved, and its stats have increased by 20% (Well done you!)! Now, it’s time to calculate its new stat (integer) after evolution. 

Given the original pokemonStat return the newly evolved Pokemon Stats

  250XP ---> 300XP
  1050XP ---> 1260XP
  100P ---> 12XP

Make sure to install vitest into your 'devDependencies'
  npm install vitest -d

Place vitest into scripts

"test": "vitest"
  npm run test*/


export function pokemonEvolveNewStats(pokemonStat) {
  // I wanna be the very best
}
